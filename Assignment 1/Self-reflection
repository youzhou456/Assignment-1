# Assignment -1 Self Reflection 
- Thought
        This Assignment - 1 tooks me about 30 hrs to figure most of the codes out. To be honest, I took a lot of references and the idea of solving the problem from different coding community platform like stackflow, W3Schools,leetcode, etc. And for a non-programming backgroud person like me, the process is hard and tedious. Eventhough I somehow figured out the code and get the result, I am still not confidence about solving more problems totally all by myself. 


- What I have learned
        Basic Variable define and manipulate,  Array manipulation( create, edit, indexing,ect) , using loop to to repeat process, if...else logic to get some basic logic judgement, etc.

- Recommendation
        The programming learning process is a highly time consuming work. I need to take more time to practice to get use to the programming environment and language.
        Hope I will spend a little less time than the first assignment next time and be more comfortable with the process and more familiar with each command and language.
